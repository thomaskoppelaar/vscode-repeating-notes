# Repeating Notes - Make a habit of taking notes.

This extension exists to help you in taking notes on a regular basis.

## Features

Adds three new commands:

- Go to daily note
- Go to weekly note
- Go to monthly note

## Roadmap

I'm planning on adding the following features:

- [X] User settings, to allow for more control over filename formatting, folder name, etc.
- [ ] Automatic file creation when opening a workspace
